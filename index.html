      Thank you for downloading our extension! You may find FAQ here.
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      Degiro is a great broker, but it may be difficult to access some important information about your portfolio, such as original invested amount, change in percents etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where <strong>Degiro Statistics</strong> comes into action. Once you accessed the Portfolio section of your Degiro account, it automatically calculates some interesting statistics about your portfolio and renders them into a table. This
      way you can have a better overview of your assets.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I know my data is safe?</h2>
    <p>
      All calculations are done locally in your browser. The extension does <b>not</b> communicate with any server in any way. This means that there is no way for us to compromise your data since it never leaves your device.
